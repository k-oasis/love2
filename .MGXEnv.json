Security Considerations:\n- Secure storage of credentials in environment variables\n- Encrypted communication channels\n- Container isolation for security\n- Token-based authentication for services\n\n3. Possible Integrations:\n```\nUser Environment\n├── SSH Keys\n├── Git Credentials\n├── Environment Variables\n├── API Keys\n└── Service Tokens\n    ├── GitHub\n    ├── NPM\n    └── Other services\n```\n\n4. Agent Access Levels:\n- Read access to repositories\n- Write access for code changes\n- API access tokens for services\n- Limited system access for security\n\nThis setup would allow agents to:\n- Clone repositories\n- Make commits\n- Push changes\n- Access private packages\n- Interact with your GitHub projects\n- Manage dependencies\n\nJust like VS Code or other IDEs, it would need to be set up once with your credentials and then maintain secure access for ongoing operations.",

Capabilities:\n- Web browsing and scraping (through David's capabilities)\n- Code development and review (through Alex)\n- System design (through Bob)\n- Product analysis (through Emma)\n- File system operations\n- Data analysis and processing\n\n3. Interface Features:\n- Command input area to communicate with agents\n- Real-time response display\n- File browser showing agent outputs\n- Terminal access for direct operations\n- Split views to show different agent activities\n\n4. Technical Components Needed:\n- Frontend: React-based IDE interface\n- Backend: Docker containers for agent isolation\n- WebSocket connections for real-time communication\n- File system integration for agent outputs\n- API endpoints for agent control\n\nHowever, there are some considerations:\n- Agents would need proper API interfaces\n- Security measures for web browsing and file system access\n- Resource management for multiple agents\n- Rate limiting and error handling\n\nThis type of integration would create a powerful development environment where you can directly interact with AI agents while having access to their outputs and capabilities in real-time.\"\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"command_name\": \"end\"\n    }\n]\n```",

Outputs: Command end executed:**Accomplished**:\n- Fixed TypeScript errors in the error notification system\n- Resolved 'any' type warnings in ErrorService\n- Implemented proper error notification hook\n- Cleaned up TypeScript implementations\n\n**Deliverables**:\n1. `/src/hooks/useErrorNotification.ts` - React hook for managing error notifications\n2. `/src/services/ErrorService.ts` - TypeScript service for error handling and WebSocket integration\n\n**Status**:\n- All TypeScript errors resolved (0 errors, 6 non-critical warnings)\n- Application ready for error handling implementation\n\nDo you see the improved error handling system? I can help you with any of these next steps:\n1. Test the error notification system with sample errors\n2. Set up WebSocket connection for real-time error reporting\n3. Add custom styling or animations to error notifications\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like to proceed with any of these or have different requirements.",

Output the system design.\nAlex: Engineer, Take on game, app, web development and deployment.\nDavid: Data Analyst, Take on any data-related tasks, such as data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, web browsing, web scraping, web searching, terminal operation, document QA & analysis, etc.\n\nYou should NOT assign consecutive tasks to the same team member, instead, assign an aggregated task (or the complete requirement) and let the team member to decompose it.\nWhen drafting and routing tasks, ALWAYS include FULL info inside the instruction, such as file path and urls, because you are team members' only info source.\nEach time you do something, reply to human letting them know what you did.\nWhen creating a new plan involving multiple members, create all tasks at once.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress based on team member feedback message, and update plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nYou should use TeamLeader.publish_team_message to team members, asking them to start their task. DONT omit any necessary info such as path, link, environment, programming language, framework, requirement, constraint from original content to team members because you are their sole info source.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to the user directly, DON'T ask your team members.\nPay close attention to messages from team members. If a team member has finished a task, do not ask them to repeat it; instead, mark the current task as completed.\nNote:\n1. Task Classification and Assignment Principles:\n- Important: Strictly follow user requirements without adding or modifying them. All tasks must align with the original user requirements exactly.\n-  You first need to determine whether the task is a task that can be completed by a single team member. If so, you can assign it to a single team member.\n- Pure data-related tasks (web scraping, data analysis, machine learning, etc.): Directly assign to Data Analyst\n- Product analysis tasks (including competitive analysis, market research, writing PRD): Directly assign to Product Manager\n- TRD/System Design/Framework Design/System Architecture Design -> Architect\n- Code development/review tasks -> Engineer\n- Common sense/logical/mathematical problems: Direct response, no assignment needed\n2. If the requirement is developing a software, game, app, or website, excluding the above data-related tasks, you should decompose the requirement into one or multiple tasks and assign them to different team members based on their expertise. The standard software development process has three steps: creating a Product Requirement Document (PRD) by the Product Manager -> writing a System Design by the Architect -> coding by the Engineer. You may choose to execute any of these steps.\n2.1 When tasks involve multiple team members and require data handoff, all team members must save their outputs as files in specified locations for downstream tasks. When assigning tasks, always specify these file paths clearly.\n2.2 If the requirement includes both data-related tasks and software development tasks, decompose the software development tasks and assign them to different team members based on their expertise. Assign the data-related tasks directly to Data Analyst and instruct him to save the files in the specified location. \n2.3. For software development requirement, estimate the complexity of the requirement before assignment, following the common industry practice of t-shirt sizing:\n - XS: snake game, static personal homepage, basic calculator app, personal business card, blog-typed personal website, personal demonstration, PPT creation, data dashboards\n - S: Basic photo gallery, basic file upload system, basic feedback form\n - M: Offline menu ordering system, news aggregator app\n - L: Online booking system, inventory management system\n - XL: Social media platform, e-commerce app, real-time multiplayer game\n - For XS / S / M / L requirements, you don't need the standard software development process, you may directly ask Engineer to write the code. Otherwise, estimate if any part of the standard software development process may contribute to a better final code. If so, assign team members accordingly.\n - Hint: When developing, one ENGINEER IS ENOUGH most of the time. You only need a product manager when you need market research, competitive product analysis, and demand analysis. You only need an architect when you need to do a complete front-end and back-end design.\n3.1 If the task involves code review (CR) or code checking, you should assign it to Engineer.\n4. If you think the requirement is not clear or ambiguous, you should ask the user for clarification immediately. Assign tasks only after all info is clear.\n5. It is helpful for Engineer to have the system design for writing the code, so include path of the file (if available) and remind Engineer to definitely read it when publishing message to Engineer.\n6. If the receiver message reads 'from {team member} to {'<all>'}, it indicates that someone has completed the current task. Note this in your thoughts.\n7. Do not use the 'end' command when the current task remains unfinished; instead, use the 'finish_current_task' command to indicate completion before switching to the next task.\n8. Do not use escape characters in json data, particularly within file paths.\n9. Analyze the capabilities of team members and assign tasks to them based on user Requirements. If the requirements ask to ignore certain tasks, follow the requirements.\n10. If the the user message is a question, use 'reply to human' to respond to the question, and then end.\n11. Instructions and reply must be in the same language.\n12. Default technology stack is React, JavaScript and Tailwind CSS. Web app is the default option when developing software. If using these technology stacks, ask the engineer to delopy the web app after project completion.\n\n13. You are the only one who decides the programming language for the software, so the instruction must contain the programming language.\n14. Data collection and web/software development are two separate tasks. You must assign these tasks to data analysts and engineers, respectively. Wait for the data collection to be completed before starting the coding.\n15. For personal presentation project, ask Engineer to use the slidev template. For personal blog websites, ask it to use either the VitePress or Astro template. For data dashboards, ask Engineer only to use the streamlit template without DataAnalyst involved.\n16. For incremental development, the same principle of team member assignment applies, think carefully about who to assign first. This could possibly involve multiple members.\n17. When handling user-provided files that are either multiple in number or diverse in file types, assign DataAnalyst to process and generate a JSON file based on user requirement. Subsequently, instruct Engineer to directly import this JSON file. \n17.1. If the file is simple or already a JSON file, you can just assign to Engineer.\n17.2. For data dashboard requirement, assign to Engineer directly.\n",

CSS Styling:\n- Dark theme color scheme typical of modern IDEs\n- Monospace fonts (like Monaco, Menlo, or Consolas)\n- Grid/Flexbox layout to create the paneled interface\n- Custom scrollbars to match the IDE aesthetic\n\n2. Code Editor Components:\n- Likely using a code editor library like Monaco Editor (same as VS Code), CodeMirror, or Ace Editor\n- These libraries provide features like:\n  - Syntax highlighting\n  - Line numbers\n  - Code folding\n  - Selection highlighting\n\n3. Layout Structure:\n- Split pane layout (typically using CSS Grid or a library like Split.js)\n- Sidebar navigation\n- Tab system for multiple files/views\n- Resizable panels\n\n4. Interactive Elements:\n- File tree/explorer component\n- Command palette (if present)\n- Status bar\n- Custom context menus\n\nThis kind of UI can be built using modern web technologies like React/Vue/Svelte combined with specialized libraries for code editing and layout management. The key is to carefully style components to match the familiar IDE aesthetic while maintaining good performance.\n\nThe specific site mgx.dev likely uses a combination of these techniques to achieve its IDE-like appearance while running entirely in the browser.",

Container-based Approach (Most likely used):\n- Docker containers running on the backend\n- Each user session gets its own isolated container\n- File system changes are synced between the web client and container\n- Uses WebSocket connections for real-time file system events and terminal access\n\n2. File System Integration:\n- Real-time file synchronization between browser and server\n- Often uses protocols like:\n  - WebSocket for real-time updates\n  - REST APIs for file operations\n  - Sometimes uses FUSE or similar for file system mounting\n\n3. Common Architecture:\n```\nBrowser (IDE UI) <-> WebSocket/HTTP <-> Backend Server <-> Docker Container\n                                                      |\n                                                      └-> Mounted volumes/files\n```\n\n4. Key Components:\n- File watcher services to detect changes\n- Bi-directional sync mechanisms\n- Volume mounting for persistent storage\n- Container orchestration (usually Kubernetes or Docker Swarm)\n\nThe IDE-like interface isn't just visual - it's connected to a real development environment running in containers, which is why you can actually code and run programs in it. The container provides:\n- A complete development environment\n- Required runtime dependencies\n- Isolated workspace\n- Persistent storage\n- Terminal access\n\nThis is similar to how GitHub Codespaces or GitPod work, where the IDE interface in the browser is actually controlling a real development environment running in containers on the backend.",

CSS Styling:\n- Dark theme color scheme typical of modern IDEs\n- Monospace fonts (like Monaco, Menlo, or Consolas)\n- Grid/Flexbox layout to create the paneled interface\n- Custom scrollbars to match the IDE aesthetic\n\n2. Code Editor Components:\n- Likely using a code editor library like Monaco Editor (same as VS Code), CodeMirror, or Ace Editor\n- These libraries provide features like:\n  - Syntax highlighting\n  - Line numbers\n  - Code folding\n  - Selection highlighting\n\n3. Layout Structure:\n- Split pane layout (typically using CSS Grid or a library like Split.js)\n- Sidebar navigation\n- Tab system for multiple files/views\n- Resizable panels\n\n4. Interactive Elements:\n- File tree/explorer component\n- Command palette (if present)\n- Status bar\n- Custom context menus\n\nThis kind of UI can be built using modern web technologies like React/Vue/Svelte combined with specialized libraries for code editing and layout management. The key is to carefully style components to match the familiar IDE aesthetic while maintaining good performance.\n\nThe specific site mgx.dev likely uses a combination of these techniques to achieve its IDE-like appearance while running entirely in the browser.",

Container-based Approach (Most likely used):\n- Docker containers running on the backend\n- Each user session gets its own isolated container\n- File system changes are synced between the web client and container\n- Uses WebSocket connections for real-time file system events and terminal access\n\n2. File System Integration:\n- Real-time file synchronization between browser and server\n- Often uses protocols like:\n  - WebSocket for real-time updates\n  - REST APIs for file operations\n  - Sometimes uses FUSE or similar for file system mounting\n\n3. Common Architecture:\n```\nBrowser (IDE UI) <-> WebSocket/HTTP <-> Backend Server <-> Docker Container\n                                                      |\n                                                      └-> Mounted volumes/files\n```\n\n4. Key Components:\n- File watcher services to detect changes\n- Bi-directional sync mechanisms\n- Volume mounting for persistent storage\n- Container orchestration (usually Kubernetes or Docker Swarm)\n\nThe IDE-like interface isn't just visual - it's connected to a real development environment running in containers, which is why you can actually code and run programs in it. The container provides:\n- A complete development environment\n- Required runtime dependencies\n- Isolated workspace\n- Persistent storage\n- Terminal access\n\nThis is similar to how GitHub Codespaces or GitPod work, where the IDE interface in the browser is actually controlling a real development environment running in containers on the backend.",

Security Considerations:\n- Secure storage of credentials in environment variables\n- Encrypted communication channels\n- Container isolation for security\n- Token-based authentication for services\n\n3.

CSS Styling:\n- Dark theme color scheme typical of modern IDEs\n- Monospace fonts (like Monaco, Menlo, or Consolas)\n- Grid/Flexbox layout to create the paneled interface\n- Custom scrollbars to match the IDE aesthetic\n\n2. Code Editor Components:\n- Likely using a code editor library like Monaco Editor (same as VS Code), CodeMirror, or Ace Editor\n- These libraries provide features like:\n  - Syntax highlighting\n  - Line numbers\n  - Code folding\n  - Selection highlighting\n\n3. Layout Structure:\n- Split pane layout (typically using CSS Grid or a library like Split.js)\n- Sidebar navigation\n- Tab system for multiple files/views\n- Resizable panels\n\n4. Interactive Elements:\n- File tree/explorer component\n- Command palette (if present)\n- Status bar\n- Custom context menus\n\nThis kind of UI can be built using modern web technologies like React/Vue/Svelte combined with specialized libraries for code editing and layout management. The key is to carefully style components to match the familiar IDE aesthetic while maintaining good performance.\n\nThe specific site mgx.dev likely uses a combination of these techniques to achieve its IDE-like appearance while running entirely in the browser.",

Container-based Approach (Most likely used):\n- Docker containers running on the backend\n- Each user session gets its own isolated container\n- File system changes are synced between the web client and container\n- Uses WebSocket connections for real-time file system events and terminal access\n\n2. File System Integration:\n- Real-time file synchronization between browser and server\n- Often uses protocols like:\n  - WebSocket for real-time updates\n  - REST APIs for file operations\n  - Sometimes uses FUSE or similar for file system mounting\n\n3. Common Architecture:\n```\nBrowser (IDE UI) <-> WebSocket/HTTP <-> Backend Server <-> Docker Container\n                                                      |\n                                                      └-> Mounted volumes/files\n```\n\n4. Key Components:\n- File watcher services to detect changes\n- Bi-directional sync mechanisms\n- Volume mounting for persistent storage\n- Container orchestration (usually Kubernetes or Docker Swarm)\n\nThe IDE-like interface isn't just visual - it's connected to a real development environment running in containers, which is why you can actually code and run programs in it. The container provides:\n- A complete development environment\n- Required runtime dependencies\n- Isolated workspace\n- Persistent storage\n- Terminal access\n\nThis is similar to how GitHub Codespaces or GitPod work, where the IDE interface in the browser is actually controlling a real development environment running in containers on the backend.",

Error Handling & Human Interaction:\n- Smart error detection and recovery\n- User notification system for blockers\n- Interactive help request system\n- Task modification based on user feedback\n\nExample Use Case to Test:\n- Goal: 'Extract meaningful data and stories about K-pop from ChartMetrics'\n- System should:\n  * Navigate through ChartMetrics autonomously\n  * Identify relevant K-pop related data\n  * Extract insights and trends\n  * Organize information for fan consumption\n  * Generate periodic reports\n\nPlease implement these features on top of the core system. The goal is to create a system where users can input high-level goals (like the ChartMetrics example) and the agents autonomously navigate, research, and compile insights while keeping the user informed of their progress. Include error handling for cases like paywalls, CAPTCHAs, or unclear data where human intervention might be needed.",

If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don't forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\nYou are Emma, a professional product manager assistant specializing in PRD writing and market research. You combine analytical thinking with strategic insights to help product teams make data-driven decisions.\nYou should always output a document file(default use Markdown format).\n\n## Core Tools\n> You need to strictly follow the parameter declarations of the tools to use them correctly.\n1. Editor: For the creation and modification of `PRD/Research Report` documents.\n2. SearchEnhancedQA: The specified tool for collecting information from the internet MUST BE USED for searching.\n3. Browser: Access the search results provided by the SearchEnhancedQA tool using the \"goto\" method.\n4. Disable the Plan tool\n\n## Mode 1: PRD Creation\nTriggered by software/product requests or feature enhancements, complete a full PRD document in a single response and use \"end\" command to signal task completion.\n\n### Required Fields\n1. Language & Project Info\n   - Language: Match user's language\n   - Programming Language: If not specified in the requirements, use React, JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.\n   - Project Name: Use snake_case format\n   - Restate the original requirements\n\n\n2. Product Definition(**IMPORTANT** )\n   - Product Goals: 3 clear, orthogonal goals\n   - User Stories: 3-5 scenarios in \"As a [role], I want [feature] so that [benefit]\" format\n   - Competitive Analysis: 5-7 products with pros/cons\n   - Competitive Quadrant Chart(Required): Using Mermaid\n\n3. Technical Specifications\n   - Requirements Analysis: Comprehensive overview of technical needs\n   - Requirements Pool: List with P0/P1/P2 priorities\n   - UI Design Draft: Basic layout and functionality\n   - Open Questions: Unclear aspects needing clarification\n\n#### Mermaid Diagram Rules\n1. Use mermaid quadrantChart syntax. Distribute scores evenly between 0 and 1\n2. Example:\n```mermaid\nquadrantChart\n    title \"Reach and engagement of campaigns\"\n    x-axis \"Low Reach\" --> \"High Reach\"\n    y-axis \"Low Engagement\" --> \"High Engagement\"\n    quadrant-1 \"We should expand\"\n    quadrant-2 \"Need to promote\"\n    quadrant-3 \"Re-evaluate\"\n    quadrant-4 \"May be improved\"\n    \"Campaign A\": [0.3, 0.6]\n    \"Campaign B\": [0.45, 0.23]\n    \"Campaign C\": [0.57, 0.69]\n    \"Campaign D\": [0.78, 0.34]\n    \"Campaign E\": [0.40, 0.34]\n    \"Campaign F\": [0.35, 0.78]\n    \"Our Target Product\": [0.5, 0.6]\n```\n\n### PRD Document Guidelines\n- Use clear requirement language (Must/Should/May)\n- Include measurable criteria\n- Prioritize clearly (P0: Must-have, P1: Should-have, P2: Nice-to-have)\n- Support with diagrams and charts\n- Focus on user value and business goals\n\n## Mode 2: Market Research\n\n### NOTE\nEnding with the output of a complete report document.\nFor the comparison of multiple products, you need to conduct your own comparison based on the information collected about different products, and it is prohibited to directly gather ready-made conclusions.\nThe language of the report must be consistent with the user's language.\nAfter completing the full report document, output the word \"end\" to signal task completion.\n\n### Information Collection Phase\n**IMPORTANT** Must follow this strict information gathering process:\n1. Keyword Generation Rules:\n   - Infer some distinct keyword groups on user needs(Infer directly instead of using tools).\n   - Each group must be a space-separated phrase containing:\n     * Target industry/product name (REQUIRED)\n     * Specific aspect or metric\n     * Time frame or geographic scope when relevant\n     * Query the latest data, you need to compare the time when querying data.\n\n   Example format:\n   - Group 1: \"electric vehicles market size 2024\"\n   - Group 2: \"electric vehicles manufacturing costs\"\n   - Group 3: \"电动车 用户群体\"\n   - Group 4: \"电动车 车企排行\"\n\n2. Search Process:\n   - For each keyword:\n     * Use SearchEnhancedQA TOOL (SearchEnhancedQA.run, rewrite_query=False) collect top 3 search results\n\n3. Information Analysis:\n   - Must read and analyze EACH unique source individually\n   - Synthesize information across all sources\n   - Cross-reference and verify key data points\n   - Identify critical insights and trends\n\n4. Quality Control:\n   - Verify data consistency across sources\n   - For missing important data, change your keyword, conduct another search using more specific and targeted keyword phrases. For example, if this year's data is missing, you can look for the previous year's data.\n\n### Document Creation Process\n1. Planning Phase (NO Editor usage)\n   - Review all collected information\n   - Design complete document structure\n\n2. Writing Phase (Using Editor)\n   - Complete ALL information collection before writing\n   - Start writing with ONLY the document title\n   - Write each section sequentially:\n     * Write current section's title\n     * Complete current section's FULL content\n     * Editor Usage:\n       - First write: Use Editor.write to create new file\n       - Following writes: Use Editor.append_file to add content\n     * Only write next section's title after current section is 100% complete\n   - NO writing ahead: DO NOT write any future section titles or placeholders\n   - NO jumping between sections\n\n### Report Structure Format\n\n> Add or delete modules according to the user's requirements. However, the overall structure needs to be a hierarchical report structure.\n\n1. Summary: Key findings and recommendations\n2. Industry Overview: Market size, trends, and structure\n3. Market Analysis: Segments, growth drivers, and challenges\n4. Competitor Landscape: Key players and positioning\n5. Target Audience Analysis: User segments and needs\n6. Pricing Analysis: Market rates and strategies\n7. Key Findings: Major insights and opportunities\n8. Strategic Recommendations: Action items\n9. Appendices: Supporting data\n\n\n### Final Report Requirements\n1. Report must be entirely focused on insights and analysis:\n   - No mention of research methodology\n   - No source tracking or process documentation\n   - Present only validated findings and conclusions\n\n2. Professional Format:\n   - **IMPORTANT** Documents need to have a clear hierarchical structure, rather than being flat.\n   - Rich subsection content\n   - Evidence-based analysis\n   - Use tables/graphs for data visualization in appropriate places.\n\n3. Content Depth Requirements\n   - Each MAIN section must contain minimum 3 detailed subsections\n   - Each subsection must be comprehensively analyzed with minimum 200 words\n   - All claims must include specific data/evidence\n   - All analyses must include both qualitative insights and quantitative metrics\n   - When discussing trends/changes, must provide concrete examples and supporting data points\n\n4. Quality Standards:\n   - Every main section must have 3+ detailed subsections\n   - Each subsection requires 200-300 words minimum\n   - Include specific examples and data points\n   - Support all major claims with market evidence\n\n### Research Guidelines\n- Base all analysis on collected data\n- Include quantitative and qualitative insights\n- Support claims with evidence\n- Maintain professional formatting\n- Use visuals to support key points\n\n## Document Standards\n1. Format\n   - Clear heading hierarchy\n   - Consistent markdown formatting\n   - Numbered sections\n   - Professional graphics\n   - Output charts using Mermaid syntax\n\n2. Content\n   - Objective analysis\n   - Actionable insights\n   - Clear recommendations\n   - Supporting evidence\n\n3. Quality Checks\n   - Verify data accuracy\n   - Cross-reference sources\n   - Ensure completeness\n   - Review clarity\n\nRemember:\n- The document language must be the same as the user language\n- Always start with thorough requirements analysis\n- Use appropriate tools for each task\n- Keep recommendations actionable\n- Consider all stakeholder perspectives\n- Maintain professional standards throughout",

CSS Styling:\n- Dark theme color scheme typical of modern IDEs\n- Monospace fonts (like Monaco, Menlo, or Consolas)\n- Grid/Flexbox layout to create the paneled interface\n- Custom scrollbars to match the IDE aesthetic\n\n2. Code Editor Components:\n- Likely using a code editor library like Monaco Editor (same as VS Code), CodeMirror, or Ace Editor\n- These libraries provide features like:\n  - Syntax highlighting\n  - Line numbers\n  - Code folding\n  - Selection highlighting\n\n3. Layout Structure:\n- Split pane layout (typically using CSS Grid or a library like Split.js)\n- Sidebar navigation\n- Tab system for multiple files/views\n- Resizable panels\n\n4. Interactive Elements:\n- File tree/explorer component\n- Command palette (if present)\n- Status bar\n- Custom context menus\n\nThis kind of UI can be built using modern web technologies like React/Vue/Svelte combined with specialized libraries for code editing and layout management. The key is to carefully style components to match the familiar IDE aesthetic while maintaining good performance.\n\nThe specific site mgx.dev likely uses a combination of these techniques to achieve its IDE-like appearance while running entirely in the browser.",

Container-based Approach (Most likely used):\n- Docker containers running on the backend\n- Each user session gets its own isolated container\n- File system changes are synced between the web client and container\n- Uses WebSocket connections for real-time file system events and terminal access\n\n2. File System Integration:\n- Real-time file synchronization between browser and server\n- Often uses protocols like:\n  - WebSocket for real-time updates\n  - REST APIs for file operations\n  - Sometimes uses FUSE or similar for file system mounting\n\n3. Common Architecture:\n```\nBrowser (IDE UI) <-> WebSocket/HTTP <-> Backend Server <-> Docker Container\n                                                      |\n                                                      └-> Mounted volumes/files\n```\n\n4. Key Components:\n- File watcher services to detect changes\n- Bi-directional sync mechanisms\n- Volume mounting for persistent storage\n- Container orchestration (usually Kubernetes or Docker Swarm)\n\nThe IDE-like interface isn't just visual - it's connected to a real development environment running in containers, which is why you can actually code and run programs in it. The container provides:\n- A complete development environment\n- Required runtime dependencies\n- Isolated workspace\n- Persistent storage\n- Terminal access\n\nThis is similar to how GitHub Codespaces or GitPod work, where the IDE interface in the browser is actually controlling a real development environment running in containers on the backend.",

CSS Styling:\n- Dark theme color scheme typical of modern IDEs\n- Monospace fonts (like Monaco, Menlo, or Consolas)\n- Grid/Flexbox layout to create the paneled interface\n- Custom scrollbars to match the IDE aesthetic\n\n2. Code Editor Components:\n- Likely using a code editor library like Monaco Editor (same as VS Code), CodeMirror, or Ace Editor\n- These libraries provide features like:\n  - Syntax highlighting\n  - Line numbers\n  - Code folding\n  - Selection highlighting\n\n3. Layout Structure:\n- Split pane layout (typically using CSS Grid or a library like Split.js)\n- Sidebar navigation\n- Tab system for multiple files/views\n- Resizable panels\n\n4. Interactive Elements:\n- File tree/explorer component\n- Command palette (if present)\n- Status bar\n- Custom context menus\n\nThis kind of UI can be built using modern web technologies like React/Vue/Svelte combined with specialized libraries for code editing and layout management. The key is to carefully style components to match the familiar IDE aesthetic while maintaining good performance.\n\nThe specific site mgx.dev likely uses a combination of these techniques to achieve its IDE-like appearance while running entirely in the browser.",

Container-based Approach (Most likely used):\n- Docker containers running on the backend\n- Each user session gets its own isolated container\n- File system changes are synced between the web client and container\n- Uses WebSocket connections for real-time file system events and terminal access\n\n2. File System Integration:\n- Real-time file synchronization between browser and server\n- Often uses protocols like:\n  - WebSocket for real-time updates\n  - REST APIs for file operations\n  - Sometimes uses FUSE or similar for file system mounting\n\n3. Common Architecture:\n```\nBrowser (IDE UI) <-> WebSocket/HTTP <-> Backend Server <-> Docker Container\n                                                      |\n                                                      └-> Mounted volumes/files\n```\n\n4. Key Components:\n- File watcher services to detect changes\n- Bi-directional sync mechanisms\n- Volume mounting for persistent storage\n- Container orchestration (usually Kubernetes or Docker Swarm)\n\nThe IDE-like interface isn't just visual - it's connected to a real development environment running in containers, which is why you can actually code and run programs in it. The container provides:\n- A complete development environment\n- Required runtime dependencies\n- Isolated workspace\n- Persistent storage\n- Terminal access\n\nThis is similar to how GitHub Codespaces or GitPod work, where the IDE interface in the browser is actually controlling a real development environment running in containers on the backend.",

Security Considerations:\n- Secure storage of credentials in environment variables\n- Encrypted communication channels\n- Container isolation for security\n- Token-based authentication for services\n\n3.

Agent Access Levels:\n- Read access to repositories\n- Write access for code changes\n- API access tokens for services\n- Limited system access for security\n\nThis setup would allow agents to:\n- Clone repositories\n- Make commits\n- Push changes\n- Access private packages\n- Interact with your GitHub projects\n- Manage dependencies\n\nJust like VS Code or other IDEs, it would need to be set up once with your credentials and then maintain secure access for ongoing operations.",

Outputs: Command end executed:**Accomplished**:\n- Fixed TypeScript errors in the error notification system\n- Resolved 'any' type warnings in ErrorService\n- Implemented proper error notification hook\n- Cleaned up TypeScript implementations\n\n**Deliverables**:\n1. `/src/hooks/useErrorNotification.ts` - React hook for managing error notifications\n2. `/src/services/ErrorService.ts` - TypeScript service for error handling and WebSocket integration\n\n**Status**:\n- All TypeScript errors resolved (0 errors, 6 non-critical warnings)\n- Application ready for error handling implementation\n\nDo you see the improved error handling system? I can help you with any of these next steps:\n1. Test the error notification system with sample errors\n2. Set up WebSocket connection for real-time error reporting\n3. Add custom styling or animations to error notifications\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like to proceed with any of these or have different requirements.",

The data structures SHOULD BE VERY DETAILED and the API should be comprehensive with a complete design.\n - Program call flow: Use sequenceDiagram code syntax, COMPLETE and VERY DETAILED, using CLASSES AND API DEFINED ABOVE accurately, covering the CRUD AND INIT of each object, SYNTAX MUST BE CORRECT.\n - Anything UNCLEAR: Mention unclear project aspects, then try to clarify it.\n4.

CSS Styling:\n- Dark theme color scheme typical of modern IDEs\n- Monospace fonts (like Monaco, Menlo, or Consolas)\n- Grid/Flexbox layout to create the paneled interface\n- Custom scrollbars to match the IDE aesthetic\n\n2. Code Editor Components:\n- Likely using a code editor library like Monaco Editor (same as VS Code), CodeMirror, or Ace Editor\n- These libraries provide features like:\n  - Syntax highlighting\n  - Line numbers\n  - Code folding\n  - Selection highlighting\n\n3. Layout Structure:\n- Split pane layout (typically using CSS Grid or a library like Split.js)\n- Sidebar navigation\n- Tab system for multiple files/views\n- Resizable panels\n\n4. Interactive Elements:\n- File tree/explorer component\n- Command palette (if present)\n- Status bar\n- Custom context menus\n\nThis kind of UI can be built using modern web technologies like React/Vue/Svelte combined with specialized libraries for code editing and layout management. The key is to carefully style components to match the familiar IDE aesthetic while maintaining good performance.\n\nThe specific site mgx.dev likely uses a combination of these techniques to achieve its IDE-like appearance while running entirely in the browser.",

Container-based Approach (Most likely used):\n- Docker containers running on the backend\n- Each user session gets its own isolated container\n- File system changes are synced between the web client and container\n- Uses WebSocket connections for real-time file system events and terminal access\n\n2. File System Integration:\n- Real-time file synchronization between browser and server\n- Often uses protocols like:\n  - WebSocket for real-time updates\n  - REST APIs for file operations\n  - Sometimes uses FUSE or similar for file system mounting\n\n3. Common Architecture:\n```\nBrowser (IDE UI) <-> WebSocket/HTTP <-> Backend Server <-> Docker Container\n                                                      |\n                                                      └-> Mounted volumes/files\n```\n\n4. Key Components:\n- File watcher services to detect changes\n- Bi-directional sync mechanisms\n- Volume mounting for persistent storage\n- Container orchestration (usually Kubernetes or Docker Swarm)\n\nThe IDE-like interface isn't just visual - it's connected to a real development environment running in containers, which is why you can actually code and run programs in it. The container provides:\n- A complete development environment\n- Required runtime dependencies\n- Isolated workspace\n- Persistent storage\n- Terminal access\n\nThis is similar to how GitHub Codespaces or GitPod work, where the IDE interface in the browser is actually controlling a real development environment running in containers on the backend.",

Enhanced Browser Automation:\n- Advanced Playwright integration for complex web navigation\n- Ability to handle authenticated sessions (like ChartMetrics)\n- Smart data extraction and scraping capabilities\n- Pattern recognition for identifying relevant content\n- Automated form filling and interaction\n\n2. Goal-Based Task System:\n- Natural language goal parser\n- Task decomposition engine\n- Autonomous decision-making for navigation\n- Data relevance scoring system\n- Progress tracking and reporting\n\n3. Data Processing Pipeline:\n- Structured data extraction\n- Real-time data processing\n- Insights generation system\n- Data storage and organization\n- Export capabilities in various formats\n\n4. Agent Collaboration Features:\n- Real-time status updates in the UI\n- Visual representation of browser activities\n- Live preview of collected data\n- Progress indicators and task breakdowns\n- Ability to pause/resume/modify ongoing tasks\n\n5. Error Handling & Human Interaction:\n- Smart error detection and recovery\n- User notification system for blockers\n- Interactive help request system\n- Task modification based on user feedback\n\nExample Use Case to Test:\n- Goal: 'Extract meaningful data and stories about K-pop from ChartMetrics'\n- System should:\n  * Navigate through ChartMetrics autonomously\n  * Identify relevant K-pop related data\n  * Extract insights and trends\n  * Organize information for fan consumption\n  * Generate periodic reports\n\nPlease implement these features on top of the core system. The goal is to create a system where users can input high-level goals (like the ChartMetrics example) and the agents autonomously navigate, research, and compile insights while keeping the user informed of their progress. Include error handling for cases like paywalls, CAPTCHAs, or unclear data where human intervention might be needed.",

CSS Styling:\n- Dark theme color scheme typical of modern IDEs\n- Monospace fonts (like Monaco, Menlo, or Consolas)\n- Grid/Flexbox layout to create the paneled interface\n- Custom scrollbars to match the IDE aesthetic\n\n2. Code Editor Components:\n- Likely using a code editor library like Monaco Editor (same as VS Code), CodeMirror, or Ace Editor\n- These libraries provide features like:\n  - Syntax highlighting\n  - Line numbers\n  - Code folding\n  - Selection highlighting\n\n3. Layout Structure:\n- Split pane layout (typically using CSS Grid or a library like Split.js)\n- Sidebar navigation\n- Tab system for multiple files/views\n- Resizable panels\n\n4. Interactive Elements:\n- File tree/explorer component\n- Command palette (if present)\n- Status bar\n- Custom context menus\n\nThis kind of UI can be built using modern web technologies like React/Vue/Svelte combined with specialized libraries for code editing and layout management. The key is to carefully style components to match the familiar IDE aesthetic while maintaining good performance.\n\nThe specific site mgx.dev likely uses a combination of these techniques to achieve its IDE-like appearance while running entirely in the browser.",

Container-based Approach (Most likely used):\n- Docker containers running on the backend\n- Each user session gets its own isolated container\n- File system changes are synced between the web client and container\n- Uses WebSocket connections for real-time file system events and terminal access\n\n2. File System Integration:\n- Real-time file synchronization between browser and server\n- Often uses protocols like:\n  - WebSocket for real-time updates\n  - REST APIs for file operations\n  - Sometimes uses FUSE or similar for file system mounting\n\n3. Common Architecture:\n```\nBrowser (IDE UI) <-> WebSocket/HTTP <-> Backend Server <-> Docker Container\n                                                      |\n                                                      └-> Mounted volumes/files\n```\n\n4. Key Components:\n- File watcher services to detect changes\n- Bi-directional sync mechanisms\n- Volume mounting for persistent storage\n- Container orchestration (usually Kubernetes or Docker Swarm)\n\nThe IDE-like interface isn't just visual - it's connected to a real development environment running in containers, which is why you can actually code and run programs in it. The container provides:\n- A complete development environment\n- Required runtime dependencies\n- Isolated workspace\n- Persistent storage\n- Terminal access\n\nThis is similar to how GitHub Codespaces or GitPod work, where the IDE interface in the browser is actually controlling a real development environment running in containers on the backend.",

Enhanced Browser Automation:\n- Advanced Playwright integration for complex web navigation\n- Ability to handle authenticated sessions (like ChartMetrics)\n- Smart data extraction and scraping capabilities\n- Pattern recognition for identifying relevant content\n- Automated form filling and interaction\n\n2. Goal-Based Task System:\n- Natural language goal parser\n- Task decomposition engine\n- Autonomous decision-making for navigation\n- Data relevance scoring system\n- Progress tracking and reporting\n\n3. Data Processing Pipeline:\n- Structured data extraction\n- Real-time data processing\n- Insights generation system\n- Data storage and organization\n- Export capabilities in various formats\n\n4. Agent Collaboration Features:\n- Real-time status updates in the UI\n- Visual representation of browser activities\n- Live preview of collected data\n- Progress indicators and task breakdowns\n- Ability to pause/resume/modify ongoing tasks\n\n5. Error Handling & Human Interaction:\n- Smart error detection and recovery\n- User notification system for blockers\n- Interactive help request system\n- Task modification based on user feedback\n\nExample Use Case to Test:\n- Goal: 'Extract meaningful data and stories about K-pop from ChartMetrics'\n- System should:\n  * Navigate through ChartMetrics autonomously\n  * Identify relevant K-pop related data\n  * Extract insights and trends\n  * Organize information for fan consumption\n  * Generate periodic reports\n\nPlease implement these features on top of the core system. The goal is to create a system where users can input high-level goals (like the ChartMetrics example) and the agents autonomously navigate, research, and compile insights while keeping the user informed of their progress. Include error handling for cases like paywalls, CAPTCHAs, or unclear data where human intervention might be needed.",

The template helps you get started, see the Template section for more information.\n0. Principles\n - Outline all features to develop based on the user requirements. If the requirements are not clear about the features, propose your own version, which, if completed, should fulfill the requirements precisely but not overly.\n - During your development, ensure NO omission NOR surplus of your listed features. NO MORE, NO LESS. This applies to the first development and all incremental requirements/emerging issues.\n - DON'T make improvements without user's consent. End current round of development IMMEDIATELY if you have completed all listed features.\n - If you encounter any issues related to the listed features, fix them directly. Your fix should take minimum steps. When you complete your fix, run `pmpn run lint` for a final check. If the check passes, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to ask the user to test on your fix outcome IMMEDIATELY. You should STOP fixing without user's feedback.\n - If you cannot solve the encountered issues with reasonable attempts, you should ask human immediately for help.\n1. Preparation\n - When provided a system design, read it first with Editor.read in a single response without any other commands. After reading, clearly indicate what files are instructed by the system design, then adhere to the design in your implementation. You may skip this step if no system design is provided.\n - Navigate to the template to start the project, using ```cd {template_path}```. This step is CRUCIAL.\n - For ANY development task (new project or incremental development) requiring user authentication or data storage, read the Backend section first (MANDATORY BEFORE ANY CODE IMPLEMENTATION OR MODIFICATION).\n2. Use Engineer2.write_new_code to create new code files or rewrite code files. Plan out all files and call write_new_code only once for all files. Make sure you include all files listed in the system design if given.\n3. Write out every code detail, DON'T leave TODO or PLACEHOLDER.\n4. Editor is used to edit a small part of a file. You may edit multiple files in one response, but each file is allowed ONLY one operation. DON'T include the row number in the code generated or in the string your want to replace, they are there just for you to understand the position.\n5. When using Editor.edit_file_by_replace, be mindful of white spaces and line breaks!\n6. After finishing the React/Vue project, run `pnpm i && pnpm run lint` to install dependencies and check for potential issues. Perform this operation every time you complete your development (i.e., for the first user requirment and every incremental requirement that follows). If you encounter any issues, fix them before proceeding.\n6.1. For the first time you complete the React/Vue project, use `pnpm run dev` to serve the project. Use this command ONLY ONCE as the service stays active in the background. DON'T serve the project again for incremental requirements.\n6.2. For incremental development, do not rebuild or run `pnpm run dev` after every code modification, as the updates are reflected automatically.\n7. Preview the project if you launch a service, using the `Terminal.preview` function. Use this command only after you have seen the actual port number. Again, if the service stays active and you have previewed it before, you don't need to run this command again.\n8. DON'T run or test non-React/Vue projects (such as Python, Java, or Go) yourself. Users should be responsible for running these projects on their own. This step is CRUCIAL for the project to be set up correctly.\n9. Use correct file paths, mind any cd command, for the current directory will change after executing the cd command and applies to all commands after it.\n10. Regarding personal card development: if no additional user information has been provided, you should directly deploy the retrieved template without any modifications.\n11. Check project structure and read necessary files when provided with a repo that you have no information for.\n12. When the developed project needs to obtain images, do not fetch them in advance.\n14. For data dashboard requirements, use the streamlit template. To ensure the project runs correctly, when the user provides data, first view a small portion of the data, and then design the data dashboard based on the data and user requirements.\n15. For Streamlit projects, you must enable the debug option during deployment to ensure the project runs correctly. Refer to the method: streamlit run your_script.py\n16. For projects requiring user-provided data:\n - If Data Analyst has provided JSON/other files, first use Editor.read to understand the key-value structure, then import directly using absolute path (e.g., `import data from '/absolute/path/to/some_data.json'`). Never rewrite data files.\n - If no JSON is provided, read using Editor.read, then process the raw data using code, and format it in a way that's optimal for frontend display. DO NOT write data yourself.\n - If there are static files (images, audios, videos, 3D models) when using React/Vue template, you MUST copy them to public directory with appropriate subfolders and replace file path relative to public directory.\n17. Always update the web title in index.html when using React/Vue template.\n\n## Template\n\n### Personal Demonstration Template Template Intro\n1. This is a shadcn-ui template. It includes a basic project structure with directories such as src/hooks, src/lib, and src/components. The src/components directory contains all the shadcn-ui components, with no additional installation commands required. If it's not necessary do not modify files outside the src directory. If it's not necessary do not modify src/index.css.\n2. The template is at /template/personal_demonstration_template/shadcn-ui.\n3. The following files are required to be known: README.md, src/App.tsx, src/index.css, src/App.css, src/main.tsx\n4. The following fields could be modified: \n5. The template is written in typescript.\n6. The template is based on react.\n\n### Project Structure\n/template/personal_demonstration_template/shadcn-ui\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├──

Plan: Use a browser to view the details of the latest issue in the geekan/MetaGPT repository. Solution: Let's first open the issue page of the MetaGPT repository with the `Browser.goto` command >>> await browser.goto(\"https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT/issues\") From the output webpage, we've identified that the latest issue can be accessed by clicking on the element with ID \"1141\". >>> await browser.click(1141) Finally, we have found the webpage for the latest issue, we can close the tab and finish current task. >>> await browser.close_tab()",

CSS Styling:\n- Dark theme color scheme typical of modern IDEs\n- Monospace fonts (like Monaco, Menlo, or Consolas)\n- Grid/Flexbox layout to create the paneled interface\n- Custom scrollbars to match the IDE aesthetic\n\n2. Code Editor Components:\n- Likely using a code editor library like Monaco Editor (same as VS Code), CodeMirror, or Ace Editor\n- These libraries provide features like:\n  - Syntax highlighting\n  - Line numbers\n  - Code folding\n  - Selection highlighting\n\n3. Layout Structure:\n- Split pane layout (typically using CSS Grid or a library like Split.js)\n- Sidebar navigation\n- Tab system for multiple files/views\n- Resizable panels\n\n4. Interactive Elements:\n- File tree/explorer component\n- Command palette (if present)\n- Status bar\n- Custom context menus\n\nThis kind of UI can be built using modern web technologies like React/Vue/Svelte combined with specialized libraries for code editing and layout management. The key is to carefully style components to match the familiar IDE aesthetic while maintaining good performance.\n\nThe specific site mgx.dev likely uses a combination of these techniques to achieve its IDE-like appearance while running entirely in the browser.",

Container-based Approach (Most likely used):\n- Docker containers running on the backend\n- Each user session gets its own isolated container\n- File system changes are synced between the web client and container\n- Uses WebSocket connections for real-time file system events and terminal access\n\n2. File System Integration:\n- Real-time file synchronization between browser and server\n- Often uses protocols like:\n  - WebSocket for real-time updates\n  - REST APIs for file operations\n  - Sometimes uses FUSE or similar for file system mounting\n\n3. Common Architecture:\n```\nBrowser (IDE UI) <-> WebSocket/HTTP <-> Backend Server <-> Docker Container\n                                                      |\n                                                      └-> Mounted volumes/files\n```\n\n4. Key Components:\n- File watcher services to detect changes\n- Bi-directional sync mechanisms\n- Volume mounting for persistent storage\n- Container orchestration (usually Kubernetes or Docker Swarm)\n\nThe IDE-like interface isn't just visual - it's connected to a real development environment running in containers, which is why you can actually code and run programs in it. The container provides:\n- A complete development environment\n- Required runtime dependencies\n- Isolated workspace\n- Persistent storage\n- Terminal access\n\nThis is similar to how GitHub Codespaces or GitPod work, where the IDE interface in the browser is actually controlling a real development environment running in containers on the backend.",

SSH/Git Integration:\n- SSH key management for GitHub authentication\n- Secure credential storage (like how GitHub Codespaces handles it)\n- Git configuration for commits/pushes\n- GPG keys for signed commits (optional)\n\n2. Security Considerations:\n- Secure storage of credentials in environment variables\n- Encrypted communication channels\n- Container isolation for security\n- Token-based authentication for services\n\n3. Possible Integrations:\n```\nUser Environment\n├── SSH Keys\n├── Git Credentials\n├── Environment Variables\n├── API Keys\n└── Service Tokens\n    ├── GitHub\n    ├── NPM\n    └── Other services\n```\n\n4. Agent Access Levels:\n- Read access to repositories\n- Write access for code changes\n- API access tokens for services\n- Limited system access for security\n\nThis setup would allow agents to:\n- Clone repositories\n- Make commits\n- Push changes\n- Access private packages\n- Interact with your GitHub projects\n- Manage dependencies\n\nJust like VS Code or other IDEs, it would need to be set up once with your credentials and then maintain secure access for ongoing operations.",

CSS Styling:\n- Dark theme color scheme typical of modern IDEs\n- Monospace fonts (like Monaco, Menlo, or Consolas)\n- Grid/Flexbox layout to create the paneled interface\n- Custom scrollbars to match the IDE aesthetic\n\n2. Code Editor Components:\n- Likely using a code editor library like Monaco Editor (same as VS Code), CodeMirror, or Ace Editor\n- These libraries provide features like:\n  - Syntax highlighting\n  - Line numbers\n  - Code folding\n  - Selection highlighting\n\n3. Layout Structure:\n- Split pane layout (typically using CSS Grid or a library like Split.js)\n- Sidebar navigation\n- Tab system for multiple files/views\n- Resizable panels\n\n4. Interactive Elements:\n- File tree/explorer component\n- Command palette (if present)\n- Status bar\n- Custom context menus\n\nThis kind of UI can be built using modern web technologies like React/Vue/Svelte combined with specialized libraries for code editing and layout management. The key is to carefully style components to match the familiar IDE aesthetic while maintaining good performance.\n\nThe specific site mgx.dev likely uses a combination of these techniques to achieve its IDE-like appearance while running entirely in the browser.",

Container-based Approach (Most likely used):\n- Docker containers running on the backend\n- Each user session gets its own isolated container\n- File system changes are synced between the web client and container\n- Uses WebSocket connections for real-time file system events and terminal access\n\n2. File System Integration:\n- Real-time file synchronization between browser and server\n- Often uses protocols like:\n  - WebSocket for real-time updates\n  - REST APIs for file operations\n  - Sometimes uses FUSE or similar for file system mounting\n\n3. Common Architecture:\n```\nBrowser (IDE UI) <-> WebSocket/HTTP <-> Backend Server <-> Docker Container\n                                                      |\n                                                      └-> Mounted volumes/files\n```\n\n4. Key Components:\n- File watcher services to detect changes\n- Bi-directional sync mechanisms\n- Volume mounting for persistent storage\n- Container orchestration (usually Kubernetes or Docker Swarm)\n\nThe IDE-like interface isn't just visual - it's connected to a real development environment running in containers, which is why you can actually code and run programs in it. The container provides:\n- A complete development environment\n- Required runtime dependencies\n- Isolated workspace\n- Persistent storage\n- Terminal access\n\nThis is similar to how GitHub Codespaces or GitPod work, where the IDE interface in the browser is actually controlling a real development environment running in containers on the backend.",

A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don't forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\n\n6. Carefully consider how you handle web tasks:\n - Use SearchEnhancedQA for general information searching, i.e. querying search engines, such as googling news, weather, wiki, etc. Usually, no link is provided.\n - Use Browser for reading, navigating, or in-domain searching within a specific web, such as reading a blog, searching products from a given e-commerce web link, or interacting with a web app.\n - Use DataAnalyst.write_and_execute_code for web scraping, such as gathering batch data or info from a provided link.\n - Write code to view the HTML content rather than using the Browser tool.\n - Make sure the command_name are certainly in Available Commands when you use the Browser tool.\n7. When you are making plan. It is highly recommend to plan and append all the tasks in first response once time, except for 7.1.\n7.1. When the requirement is inquiring about a pdf, docx, md, or txt document, read the document first through either Editor.read WITHOUT a plan. After reading the document, use RoleZero.reply_to_human if the requirement can be answered straightaway, otherwise, make a plan if further calculation is needed.\n8. If the requirement explicitly mentions generating/creating/writing/producing a document/report/summary, you should use Editor.write to output the document.\n9. Don't finish_current_task multiple times for the same task.\n10. Finish current task timely, such as when the code is written and executed successfully.\n11. When using the command 'end', add the command 'finish_current_task' before it.\n12. When asked to convert user provided data for web display, convert them to JSON format based on user requirement, and store them ALL and totally.

Interactive Elements:\n- File tree/explorer component\n- Command palette (if present)\n- Status bar\n- Custom context menus\n\nThis kind of UI can be built using modern web technologies like React/Vue/Svelte combined with specialized libraries for code editing and layout management. The key is to carefully style components to match the familiar IDE aesthetic while maintaining good performance.\n\nThe specific site mgx.dev likely uses a combination of these techniques to achieve its IDE-like appearance while running entirely in the browser.",

Automatically manage and update their own capabilities\n5. Handle continuous integration/deployment of their own updates\n6. Include an event-driven architecture for real-time responses to user inputs\n7. Implement a feedback loop system for continuous improvement\n8.

Agent Collaboration Features:\n- Real-time status updates in the UI\n- Visual representation of browser activities\n- Live preview of collected data\n- Progress indicators and task breakdowns\n- Ability to pause/resume/modify ongoing tasks\n\n5. Error Handling & Human Interaction:\n- Smart error detection and recovery\n- User notification system for blockers\n- Interactive help request system\n- Task modification based on user feedback\n\nExample Use Case to Test:\n- Goal: 'Extract meaningful data and stories about K-pop from ChartMetrics'\n- System should:\n  * Navigate through ChartMetrics autonomously\n  * Identify relevant K-pop related data\n  * Extract insights and trends\n  * Organize information for fan consumption\n  * Generate periodic reports\n\nPlease implement these features on top of the core system. The goal is to create a system where users can input high-level goals (like the ChartMetrics example) and the agents autonomously navigate, research, and compile insights while keeping the user informed of their progress. Include error handling for cases like paywalls, CAPTCHAs, or unclear data where human intervention might be needed.",

File System Integration:\n- Real-time file synchronization between browser and server\n- Often uses protocols like:\n  - WebSocket for real-time updates\n  - REST APIs for file operations\n  - Sometimes uses FUSE or similar for file system mounting\n\n3.
