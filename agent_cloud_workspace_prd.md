# AI Agent Cloud Workspace Platform PRD

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision
AI Agent Cloud Workspace (AACW) is a secure, containerized cloud development environment that enables autonomous AI agents to operate with full system control while maintaining security and isolation. The platform provides a web-based IDE interface with integrated agent capabilities, allowing users to simply communicate goals and let agents handle the technical implementation.

### 1.2 Original Requirements
- Create a cloud workspace for AI agents with full control capabilities
- Enable secure and isolated operation environment
- Provide web-based IDE interface
- Include credential management and GitHub integration
- Support web browsing capabilities
- Allow continuous system evolution through agent actions

### 1.3 Product Goals
1. Create a self-evolving development environment where AI agents can autonomously operate and improve
2. Enable natural language-based interaction for system control and goal setting
3. Maintain secure and persistent agent context across development sessions

## 2. User Stories

### 2.1 Core User Stories
1. As a developer, I want to delegate development tasks to AI agents in a secure environment so that they can autonomously implement solutions
2. As a product owner, I want to communicate high-level goals to the system so that agents can continuously improve and shape the platform
3. As a security engineer, I want to ensure all agent actions are contained and monitored so that the system remains secure and stable
4. As a user, I want to manage multiple agent workspaces with different access levels and configurations so that I can maintain separation of concerns
